// A complier tries to understand what we want to do in the code, and tries to change it to lower-level language such as machine code.

// PROS WITH USING COMPILERS
// 1. Fast to run after compiling. Does optimization.

// CONS
// Slow get up and run. Starts with compiling to machine code before running.
